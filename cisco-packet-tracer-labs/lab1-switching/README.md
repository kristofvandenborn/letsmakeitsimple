In this lab you will have: 
  1. Connect the PC1 and PC2 to the switch.
  2. Configure each PC with an IP address in the same subnet.
  3. Verify the connectivity with the ping command.

  Note that we are not configuring VLANs in this lab and we have a successful outcome. This is because all the ports are 
  in VLAN 1 by default. We will configure VLANs in future labs.
