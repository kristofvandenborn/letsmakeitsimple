In this lab you will have to:
  1. Configure PC1 and PC2 with an IP address in a subnet.
  2. Choose a VLAN to configure on the switch for this subnet.
  3. Configure PC3 and PC4 with an IP address in another subnet.
  4. Choose a VLAN to configure on the switch for the subnet. 
  5. Configure the switch:
        1. Configure the VLANs (There are 2 VLANs to configure which you chose in step 2. and 4.
        2. Configure the access ports on the switch matching the VLANs you chose in 2. and 4.
  6. Verify connectivity between PC1 and PC2 and between PC3 and PC4 using the ping command. PCs 1 and 2 should not be able to reach PC 3 and 4 if you did your config correctly.
