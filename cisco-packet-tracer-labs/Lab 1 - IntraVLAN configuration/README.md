### Lab 1 - IntraVLAN configuration
In this lab we will configure 2 PCs on the same VLAN and see how communication works. The start layout of the lab consists of 2 PCs and a switch. 
Our task is to give the 2 PCs an IP address in the same range and make sure they can reach each other. You can use the ping command to verify connectivity.
